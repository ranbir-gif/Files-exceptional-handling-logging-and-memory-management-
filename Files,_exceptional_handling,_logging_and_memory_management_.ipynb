Instead of the program crashing, you can use try and except blocks to catch the error and respond to it safely. For example, if you try to divide by zero, Python can show a message instead of stopping the program. You can also use finally to run code no matter what happens. This helps make your programs more reliable and user-friendly."

These messages can go to the screen or be saved in a file. This helps you understand and fix problems later, especially in large or long-running programs. Logging is better than print because it's more flexible and professional."

You can use it to close files, disconnect from a network, or free up resources before the object is removed from memory. It helps make sure things are cleaned up properly. But be careful — Python doesn't guarantee exactly when _ _del_ _ will run, so it’s better to use it only when needed and not for important tasks like saving data."

You can also handle multiple exceptions in one line using parentheses. This keeps your program from crashing and helps you respond to each error properly."

Python uses something called automatic garbage collection to remove data that’s no longer needed, so memory isn’t wasted. You don’t need to manage memory manually—Python does most of it for you. This helps your program run smoothly and avoids memory leaks (when memory is not freed). It's one of the reasons Python is easy to use for beginners."

        "  - Memory management is important in Python because it helps your program use the computer's memory wisely. When your program creates variables, stores data, or uses objects, it takes up memory. If old or unused data is not removed, it can slow down your program or even cause it to crash. Python has a built-in system called garbage collection that automatically removes things that are no longer needed. This keeps your program fast and efficient. Good memory management also makes sure your program runs well, especially when it gets bigger or runs for a long time. It keeps everything clean and organized."

        "  - Python’s garbage collection system helps clean up memory by removing objects that are no longer needed. When you create a variable or object, Python stores it in memory. If nothing is using that object anymore, Python automatically deletes it to free up space. It does this using something called reference counting—each object keeps track of how many things are using it. When the count goes to zero, Python knows it can safely delete it. Python also has a garbage collector that finds and removes groups of unused objects. This helps your program run smoothly and avoids memory waste."
